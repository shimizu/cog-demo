This region has historically high rates of deforestation, especially associated with conflicts of land tenure, and the high value of activities of other land-use such as livestock and soybean production. The illegal exploraration of timber and other illegal activities such as hunting affect the forest, the biodiversity , the climate and consequently the local population as well. The conservation of 33,766.64 hectare of Ombrophilous Dense Forest with the CAAPII REDD+ Project will reduce more than 14 millions tCO2e of GHG emissions and bring positive impacts to the region with the project activities. The actions have as goals the preservation of the forest, as well as the improvement of the well-being of the communities, biodiversity and climate regulation. A socioeconomic diagnosis on each community involved in the project conducted the design of the project activities in order to encourage the growth of environmental awareness and the sustainable development, aligned with the conservation of the forest and fauna and flora species. With the approval of the CAAPII REDD+ Project, the forest areas inside the properties can be protected and the project activities can be implemented aiming to bring climate, community, and biodiversity benefits.",

In addition to climate benefits, the Project also aims to generate socio-environmental benefits based on sustainable economic development practices and the improvement of the well-being of surrounding communities, while preserving the culture and tradition of local peoples. The Project Area has 129,417 ha of Amazon rainforest and is located almost entirely in the mesoregion of Marajó, in the State of Pará, covering the cities of Bagre, Portel, Baião and Oeiras do Pará. It is located near BR 422, known as the Transcametá highway, and near the rivers Pacajá, Jacundá and Tocantins. Communities that are directly or indirectly influenced by the Project were identified, either because they provide labor to Fazenda Jutaituba or are geographically close to the Project Area and depend on the forest resources present in the area, such as nuts and medicinal herbs. The region has great relevance in relation to its biodiversity, being an ecological corridor that makes it possible to connect Conservation Units (UCs) that are nearby. The predominant vegetation is the Dense Ombrophilous Forest with a high density of medium and large trees, as well as woody and epiphytic lianas. It houses at least 24 species of fauna and flora with some degree of threat according to the IUCN Red List, some of which are endemic to the region. Thus, the Jutaituba REDD+ Project hopes, in addition to climate impacts, to improve the well-being of communities and generate exceptional benefits for local biodiversity.",

Juruá REDD+ Project is located at Seringal Valparaíso property, in the Alto Juruá region, between the municipalities of Cruzeiro do Sul and Porto Walter, including an area of 24,076 hectares. Juruá River basin is formed by four micro-basins: the micro-basin of Igarapé do Meio, the micro-basin of Igarapé Primeiro de Março and the Igarapé Grande micro-basin, in addition to the Valparaiso river basin (micro-basin) itself, which is the main drainage network of the rubber plantation region. The purpose of the project is to reduce GHG emissions from activities regarding to conserve the forest and its natural resources, as well as to maintain carbon stocks, through activities that promote the reduction of deforestation in the region, such as the improvement of patrimonial vigilance, the monitoring of land use change and land cover using satellite images and strengthening the management of non-timber forest products. The performance of activities allied to a good project management, with continuous monitoring and evaluation of activities and results, will allow the Project to reach the expected goals and effects. Therefore, it is expected that Juruá REDD+ Project prevents, by curbing deforestation, about 1,937,742 tCO2e by reducing GHG emissions throughout 20 years of the project. All the proposed activities to curb deforestation will become economically feasible if the management of non-timber forest products is combined with the trading of carbon credits through REDD+ carbon crediting mechanisms.",

The project areas are in the region known as the Amazon deforestation arc and are located in a region of high conversion rates from original forest habitat to pasture and/or large areas of agricultural crops. The Brazilian economy in the south of the Amazonian regions, has been based based on native forest clearing to allow cattle-ranching, often without appropriate management technologies. Considering the infertile soil in the Amazon Forest, its exposure to the weather, and to little improvement in agricultural technology the region is hampered by low productivity, leading to increasing deforestation to ensure profitability. The WARG project intends to deliver significant improvements in the area’s monitoring, with remote sensing technology implementation to identify any signs of modification in the Project Area and surroundings, in addition to training staff for field monitoring. The project will also be implementing satellite wildfire detection systems and teams of fire fighters to detect fires early before they reach an unmanageable size. The project is expected to avoid the emission of 3,620,766 tCO2eq in the first 10 years. The actual project area is 60,000 ha of native forest divided in 22 properties, with an ambitious target for continuous expansion to a total area of 500,000 ha.

Both the municipalities are inside the “Arc of Deforestation” and since the colonization of the municipalities, besides the damage caused to natural ecosystems, several social conflicts have emerged from the dynamics of unsustainable land use, associated with the extensive deforestation and degradation activities. Throughout time, communities with livelihoods based on family-scale agriculture and forest resources were expulsed from the region and gave place to large scale agricultural and pasture activities. For the project period, the baseline scenario for the Project Area indicates that the historical patterns of change in land-use would be reproduced: extensive deforestation and systematic conversion from forest to soy crops and pasture areas for cattle ranching, far above the limits stablished by the Brazilian Forest Code. The project activities are designed to avoid the deforestation drivers that would realize the referred baseline in the without project scenario, with the long-term vision of restoring the relation of local communities of rural workers with the forest areas and contribute with the transition to socioeconomic scenario build on bioeconomy principles. With project activity approval, the proponents intend to improve the mechanisms of remote and in loco surveillance, as well as implement activities that will result in other climate, community, and biodiversity benefits.",

Within those, two core boundaries — climate change and biosphere integrity — have been highlighted, each of which has the potential to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed (Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015). Inspired by a call of action, Maraui Program was designed to act upon the two wicked problems — Climate Change & Biodiversity Loss. Maraui Program intends to halt GHG emissions by avoiding ecosystem conversion while protecting Biodiversity. Furthermore, such a program aims to aid in a range of pressing issues, from preserving Freshwater Resources to improving Traditional Communities’ livelihood. The Program is a grouped project - as per VCS definition - located in the states of Piauí and Maranhão, Brazil. Owners of rich Biodiversity, Piauí and Maranhão states are home to one of the most intense agricultural frontiers of the country and are the most poverty-stricken states - the lowest average income in Brazil (IBGE, 2021).

The preserved forest is an important generator of ecosystems services such as water supply, climate regulation, tourism, energy, unique maintenance , beyond the environment with unique natural beauty. This hot spot on earth suffers a great risk of being converted to non-ecological uses, as 70% of the Brazilian GDP is concentrated in it, only 12.4% of the original forest is left in Brazil, demonstrating that they cause a huge impact on this forest, which is limited by human development and agricultural. The project area is the home to more than 50 headwaters, which flow into the São João River, an important water resource in the region. It is part of the only region of the state of Paraná with preserved native vegetation, being an important ecological corridor for the passage of fauna between two large National Parks. Areas such as the project are subject to intense risk every day, mainly due to degradation, which happens little by little, but causes a huge impact on this biome so fragile by human development. This project extends itself through the territory of the municipalities of Guaratuba and Morretes, inside the rural area where the economy is based on agriculture and extractivism, being bananas and peach palm the main crops.

Compost application in soil has the potential of contribution to the carbon cycle, where simple nutrients that return to the soil are converted by plants into organic compounds engaging sustainable agricultural land management. Soil carbon accrual per unit area is measured in both baseline and project scenarios based on the spatial coordinated sampling gathering data on soil carbon concentration with statistical rigor. The project activities were designed to improve soils, including changes to agricultural practices, compost application and enhance biodiversity in soils. The measurement of the stable SOC concentration was set up to quantify soil dynamics at depth. The soil layers up to 80cm were sampled to estimate changes in carbon stock, excluding the top-soil 20cm. Prior to the implementation of this project, rural producers do not foresee regenerative agriculture due to the lack of knowledge and technical skills about how to switch to organic input, biological control of plagues and sustainable land management. The previous scenario within the project area outcome low productivity per area, soil degradation and no smart application of the compost provided through the waste management, which implied in deposition applications without potential reuse for climate change mitigation. Nowadays, this waste gets into the circular economy by its smart reuse and social and environmental positive influence. Ambipar manages great volumes across Brazil for about 50 industrial customers.

Thus, the project area comprises 476,995 hectares of dense lowland forest, 17,705 hectares of dense alluvial forest and 5,914 hectares of dense sub-montane forest. The parcel land is situated in the municipalities of Manicoré and Novo Aripuanã, southern State of Amazonas, Brazil. The project will generate GHG emission reductions from changes in land use caused by imminent deforestation and forest degradation. The emission of 66,940,883 tons of CO2e will be avoided with the 413 project, considering a lifespan of 30 years, with an annual average of 2,231,363 tons of CO2e calculated for the whole period (2017-2046) and 6,374,716 for the first 10-year crediting period (2017-2026). The 413 Project seeks to be validated as Golden Level because exceptional climate measures will be undertaken to adapt the population to climate change. The baseline was conceived from the most-likely scenario, which is converting 20% of the forest to pasture for cattle raising. The conversion of forests to alternative land uses of up to 20% of private properties is permitted by the Brazilian Forest Code but the project proponent decided to protect forest and avoid deforestation and forest degradation, reducing CO2 emissions. In the planned deforestation approach, the conversion agent in the baseline is the owner of the area because he has the right to deforest under the current legislation.",

The landowners who decide to join the initiative, by giving up their right to legally clear their forest areas will be able to access financial resources from the carbon voluntary market, becoming BRCarbon partners. The partnership between BRCarbon (BRC) and landowners will result in legal protection to forests, forest monitoring by satellite images, forest biomass inventory using drones and innovative aero photogrammetry techniques associated with LIDAR technology, property surveillance, wildfire monitoring, prevention and firefighting activities, threatened species protection and social engagement activities with traditional communities living inside the project area.

Since 1985, the Cerrado biome has lost 46.8% of it’s native vegetation to agriculture. Conversion of native vegetation is predominantly occurring in private lands in the Cerrado biome because of Brazilian land-use regulation. The central piece of legislation regulating land use and management on private properties is the Brazilian Forest Code (Law No. 12,651, of May 25, 2012) and requires that landholders maintain a percentage of native vegetation on private lands. Currently, many landholders have surplus native vegetation in conservation on their land then legally required. According to the data calculated by Soares-Filho et al. (2014), there is approximately 40 million hectares of surplus native vegetation in the Cerrado that could be converted. Most landholders do not receive payments for ecosystem services to maintain the native vegetation, therefore, the only economic alternative is to convert native Cerrado for agricultural purposes. This results in landholders being incentivized to convert native vegetation to produce commodities, as the opportunity cost is higher. The consequence is ecosystem conversion, biodiversity loss, water loss and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Avoided Grassland Conversion Cerrado Program was launched as a grouped project to provide an alternative for landholders with surplus native vegetation to receive payments for conservation by leveraging the voluntary carbon market. The main agent of conversion, the private landholder, foregoes their legal right to convert native vegetation, and in doing so avoids GHG emissions.",

The project goal is the reforestation of degraded lands, which would continue to remain degraded, and would become increasingly more degraded, in absence of the project. The project aims to restore natural biodiverse forest and produce crops through agroforestry in other areas. This is done through Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR). A secondary goal is to expand in the region. In this case, the first farm will serve as a hub to be able to scale to adjacent farms and acquire more land to add to the project. The farm has been used extensively for cattle ranching and has an average livestock load of 600 cows. As a result, the land has been rid of its vegetation and the soil quality is gradually decreasing. The environmental damage and the decline of economic viability of the business as usual, has caused the owner to consider a sustainable strategy. The project is located in Brazil – Municipality of Bagé, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The total area of the project is 1.037 hectares and is privately owned by the Titton family (‘Owner’). An estimated 458 ha is suitable for reforestation. The project is expected to generate GHG emissions reductions through reforestation of degraded grassland. Biomass growth in the project area is expected to sequester. Also, following out the strategy a total of 244.565 tonnes of CO2 is to be sequestered by reforestation of native forest. This results in an average annual amount of 8.152,2 tonnes of CO2. The crediting period lasts 30 years and runs from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2051.",

Manoa is of paramount importance in the landscape connectivity, as it is close to conservation units and provides shelter for several species.Benefits to Climate:Avoid the emission of 279,290 tons of CO2e per year or 8,378,697 tons of CO2e along 30 years of project. This corresponds to 22,118 hectares of avoided deforestation. Benefits to the Community:With its own low-impact forest management infrastructure, the benefits to the local community and other stakeholders will be focused on training members of local associations and farm employees on issues such as agroforestry systems, low carbon agriculture, sustainable forest management, environmental eduction, and Associativism with a focus on young audiences in the region and small local producers. Another benefit will be the support in the formation of skilled labor to act in the forest and non-timber forest management chain certified, seeking a regional scope for the target public.BENEFITS TO BIODIVERSITYMaintenance of forest coverage, preventing deforestation of approximately 23,000 hectares along 30 years of project.Conservation of 177 of flora and more than 360 fauna identified species.

The Tropical Andes are one of the main coffee growing areas in Columbia and a major biodiversity hotspot, hosting 25% of the country's flora and being the richest ecoregion for birds in the country (974 bird species). However, Colombia’s Andean watersheds are threatened by uncontrolled deforestation due to rapid expansion of agriculture and cattle grazing, which strongly degrades the coffee farming conditions and the yields: low pollination, high erosion, frequent pests and diseases, low water resources. The lack of natural protection makes the farms highly vulnerable to extreme climatic events such as prolonged droughts, heavy rains, storms, landslides, etc. Besides, coffee farmers often depend on a single source of income and are highly vulnerable to market fluctuations: price volatility, demand variation, increased costs for inputs such as fertilizers, etc. Farms are not economically resilient and they are not resilient to climate change either. In this context, PUR Projet initiated an afforestation and reforestation project in Colombia in 2014, in collaboration with small-scale coffee farmers. PUR Projet is an international organization specialized in the development of ecosystems restoration and conservation projects, within agricultural supply chains like coffee and cocoa. PUR Projet also assists companies in insetting their supply chains and managing their socio-environmental commitments.",

The A/R project activity proposes to reforest ~ 1,230 ha in the area of Cáceres/Antioquia and ~ 9,640 ha in Cravo Norte/Arauca. The project areas were previously exposed to extensive cattle grazing activities. In addition to cattle grazing, some parts of the Cáceres area was exposed to alluvial gold mining. The project seeks to promote sustainable management of forest resources in a manner that fosters natural regeneration. Since 2002, Asorpar Ltd. has been reforesting land with about 25 native tree species planted in different stand models that allow for natural regeneration of flown in seeds on the reforestation sites. Asorpar Ltd. puts emphasis on promoting mixed stands. This sets their approach apart from other commercial plantation forestry entities active in Colombia. The management of mixed stands is far more challenging than of monocultures. This circumstance is reinforced by the fact that little is known about several tree species planted in the project, particularly with regard to their growth performance and silvicultural management. Hence, the proposed project activity offers a unique opportunity to obtain valuable knowledge about silvicultural management practices for mixed plantation forestry and suitability of native tree species for commercial plantation forestry.",

These impacts include the mitigation of climate change, regulation of water flows, expansion of habitat and conservation of the flora and fauna in the zone and the Orinoco region.The Project area for the first instance corresponds to the properties of La Pedregoza, El Toro, Canapro, El Diamante and Horizonte Verde, located at the veredas Caño Negro, Aceito, La Esmeralda and Campo Alegre, in the municipality of Puerto Carreño (Department of Vichada, Colombia). The land within the project boundary is degraded grassland for all cases of the grouped instances, as they all occur in the same baseline conditions. Such grasslands grasslands have been historically subject to burns that took place with the objective to reduce tree covers and expand grasslands in order to develop extensive cattle ranching activities. However, all properties conserve remnants of gallery forests and natural areas. For the first instance, it is expected to reforest around 8,700 ha with commercial plantations, using the species Acacia mangium, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Eucalyptus pellita Hevea brasiliensis, Anacardium occidentale, Pinus caribaea and other 25 native species.The project is expected to capture 1,185,191 tCO2e in 30 years, with an average annual GHG emission of 39,506 tCO2e.",

Specifically, the project is of the “Avoided Unplanned Deforestation & Degradation” (AUDD) project category.The project is estimated to generate approximately 17,921,895 VCUs over 30 years. The project area is located in Department of Izabal in the Caribbean coast region of Guatemala in the Sarstun-Motagua reference region proposed by the national level REDD+ program. Belonging to the biologically diverse Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, forests in the project area are important nationally and internationally for the ecosystem services they provide. The project area forests, however, have experienced a continued reduction in biomass due largely to small-scale farmers and medium to large scale cattle ranchers that have sought to expand their activities or have been displaced by agro-industrial expansion. These forests have also historically been an important source of income for local families, who periodically harvest small amounts of timber when the economic needs arise.In 2013 Guatemala passed the Framework for the Regulation of the Reduction of Vulnerability, the Mandatory Adaptation to the effects of Climate Change and the Mitigation of the effects of Greenhouse Gases (Decree 07-2013) which gave landowners the rights to emission reductions generated in either voluntary or compliance markets. This law allowed the REDD+ Project for Caribbean Guatemala to pursue a Grouped Project design where the project proponent, FUNDAECO, could represent small landowners and manage the development of a REDD+ project on their behalf through legal contracts that transfer project ownership to FUNDAECO.The expansion of industrial agriculture and migration of subsistence farmers and cattle ranchers into protected areas is a historical trend observed in the project zone. Consequently, forests and land within protected areas are an important source of income within the project zone and is the major focus of the REDD+ project. The project aims to alleviate these pressures on the forests through the support of governance capacity (including individual property titling, land-use planning and conservation zone demarcation), the generation of alternative economic activities and income sources, and through capacity building in administration and management. These project activities, beyond protecting local forests and biodiversity, contribute to social and economic development in one of the poorest areas of Guatemala. The effectiveness of these activities is partially dependent on their long-term economic success and wide-spread adoption. Since the project’s inception, local communities have been actively participating in the project’s formulation and implementation. The early involvement of participating communities has created awareness among community members and readiness for project implementation.",

The project aims at increasing the capacity of soil to sequester carbon, enhance the carbon sequestration by agroforestry practices such as planting of trees, reduce emissions from the use of synthetic fertilizers and reduce emissions from burning of crop residue by application of VCS methodology: VM0017 Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM). By improving soil carbon storage, protecting current soil carbon, and lowering carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions, a number of SALM techniques and technologies have been shown to lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Conservation tillage, cover crops, improved crop rotations, residue retention, agroforestry, and avoiding agricultural residue burning are a few of these techniques. The project's overarching goal is to implement sustainable management techniques that enhance soil health, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and advance the socio-economic situation of the project region. The project aims to reduce and sequester carbon leading to an estimated GHG emission reduction or removals (tCO2e) of 308,918 tCO2e / year. This project's climate benefits include emissions reduction or removals of approximately 12,356,704 tCO2e over the lifetime of the project.",

This also results in reduced GHG emission emissions associated with energy use in water pumping and methane avoidance associated with standing water in farm fields compared to the baseline. Increase in yield and reduced water and energy consumption also yields socio-economic benefits to the farmers. The first project activity instance (VPA) under the program is located in the state of Odisha in India. In the baseline, farmers were using traditional agriculture practice of rice cultivation and replaced it with SRI in the project activity. The area covered in this VPA is up to 500 hectares. In the project activity, emission reductions happen due to methane avoidance from the farm fields and reduced electricity consumption. However, emission reductions due to methane avoidance alone, are being claimed under the program. It is estimated that 60,000 tCO2e of emission reductions will be generated per annum.",

        "project_explanation": "Paddy fields are the most dominant anthropogenic sources of methane to the atmosphere (5-20% of the total emission from all anthropogenic sources ). Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants. The annual amount of CH4 emitted from a given area of rice is a function of the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation period, and organic and inorganic soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar also affect CH4 emissions. This CH4 emission-intensive cultivation method will be targeted by the proposed programme, that will involve the implementation of the technology/measures that result in reduced anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in rice cropping soils and thus reduced generation of methane. The project activity comprises of grouped projects of rice fields implementing the following methods: (a) Rice farms that change the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittent flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions; (b) Alternate wetting and drying method (AWD) (c) Rice farms that change their rice cultivation practice from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR). Thus, the measure will consist of AWD and/or DSR in combination with adjusted water management system in rice cultivation.",

The project plans to promote improved water management practices in rice cultivation instead of using the traditional practice of continuously flooded irrigation. AWD/DSR are proven methods to reduce methane emission by as much as 48% compared to flooded conditions where large amounts of methane (CH4) gets generated because of anaerobic decomposition. This project is expected to generate important co-benefits of reducing water usage during rice cultivation, decrease pest and disease attacks, improve soil health etc. Further they are also beneficial for reduced cost of cultivation for small land holders. In the first instance, the project is planned to be implemented in 23,000 hectares in Punjab and Haryana States. During the project implementation, relevant technical training and advisory was provided for the farmers to help them conduct AWD/DSR during rice cultivation. The total GHG emissions reductions due to the implementation of the project activity is estimated to be 365,299 tCO2e over 7 years, with an annual average of 52,186 tCO2e.",

This region is largely composed of small and marginal farmers, with each farming just a few hectares of land. As a result, these farmers are highly susceptible to variabilities arising from markets and weather. Over the last century, agriculture in the region has undergone a dramatic shift towards intensification. Since the late 1940s, yields of all staple crops have seen a several-fold increase. This increase was necessary to feed a growing population, but at the same time, it led to an increase of 150kg/ha in the amount of synthetic fertilizer applied to farms, along with similar increases in other crop inputs. An intensive agricultural process focused on maximizing yields every year has led to a gradual degradation of the soils of the region, resulting in CO2 emissions from the lost soil carbon. In this context, improved agricultural practices provide the opportunity and the power to reverse this land degradation and return carbon to the soil, creating carbon removals while improving overall soil health. In this project, farmers adopt a variety of improved agriculture practices. These practices are proven ways to increase soil organic carbon, and also enable farmers to improve their productivity: increases in soil organic carbon improve the ability of soils to store moisture and nutrients, and thus also help to increase yields.

CZAFL is the Project Proponent (PP) whereas EKI Energy Services Limited (Enking International) is providing carbon credit advisory services to the PP. The CZAFL has mobilized the farmers in the selected states of India to plant various tree species on their lands. These tree species range from fruit bearing trees like Indian blackberry, Guava, Mango to commercial species like Teak, Mahogany and Sandal. Simple tree cultivation techniques involving planting saplings in the pits with minimum disturbance to the lands have been employed. The lands selected for the project activity is fallow agriculture land. The PP has made contract with the farmers/land owners where they will be given tree saplings and technical support. In return, the PP will reap the benefits through sale of carbon credits. Initially, 501.7 hectares of land has been selected for the first project activity instance. Through carbon sequestration by the planted trees, the project is expected to generate annual average GHG emission reductions of removals of 10,571 tCO2e.",

Depletion of underground water, declining fertility status associated with multiple nutrient deficiencies, increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere owing to soil methanogenesis from rice cultivation and burning of rice residues are some of the end results of the intensive system. Thus, there is a challenge to balance the food production and sustainability goals simultaneously. Recent advancements in regenerative agriculture methods improve environmental outcomes without negatively impacting yields. However, agronomic, and socio-economic factors such as access to agro-advisory and the cost of technology adoption remain a crucial barrier to adopting regenerative agriculture practices. By linking smallholder farmers to carbon marketplaces, this project aims to overcome these critical barriers to adoption by enabling additional income opportunities. The project will cover the states Punjab, Haryana, and the adjoining National Capital Region (NCR), and primarily focus on the Rice - Wheat - Maize cropping system, without excluding other crops, with regenerative agricultural practices that are known to reduce GHG emissions and thus generate carbon credits by way of CO2e and SOC. With a cash incentive, the smallholder farmers in the project boundary will adopt these practices more readily and contribute to sustainability and reduce GHG emissions. A voluntary carbon marketplace for carbon credits, for the first time will create income opportunities for smallholder farmers in India via this project.",

Eight different species groups are distinguished based mainly on similar growth characteristics (similar biomass accumulation rates) and planting densities. All groups will be planted on the 6,024 ha. Coffee will be introduced after 3 years on 3,000 ha. The different species groups of the proposed ARR project activity comprise, among others, Mango, Guava, Custard apple, Orange, Lemon, and other local fruit trees. In addition Teak, Bamboo and various indigenous trees will be introduced. After a tree establishment phase, coffee will be planted under shade. The planting area is located on degraded land with very low plant cover (around 60% of the land is classified as barren land.). The horticultural tree planting will sequester carbon and generate additional income by turning this degraded, low carbon lands into high carbon sites. The overall goal of the project is to improve the livelihood of small and marginalized tribal communities in the Araku Valley of Visakhapatnam district in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. The project will turn a low carbon landscape into a high carbon multiple use landscape improving food security and generating additional income for the community. The project area will cover 333 villages in 5 different Mandals and as an average approximately 16 planting sites per village. Totally, on 5,442 discrete areas of non-forested land with a geographical identification the horticulture systems will be established. The tribal communities living in the project area are Bhagathas, Valmikies, Kamaras, Porjas and Kondhs. They converse in a dialect of Adivasi Oriya and Kui. The area is very secluded and still many of the villages are inaccessible by vehicles. 90% of the population in the project area is living below the poverty line. The livelihoods of the tribal communities in the region have a distinct set of economic characteristics which differ widely from the lowlands adjoining this area of Visakhapatnam, with respect to climate, soil, rainfall, habitat, flora, and fauna. Subsistence agriculture is the primary livelihood for nearly 99% of the tribes and special characteristics are: • Agriculture through Slash and Burn Technique on hill slopes, known as Podu cultivation; • Gathering of Non Timber Forest Products; • Farming on terraces or in valleys both under irrigated and rain fed condition, and • Cattle and backyards gardens. The current annual average income of households in the region ranges between INR.15, 000 to INR 18, 000 (USD 350-400). Indiscriminate Podu cultivation has resulted in barren lands with increased soil erosion leading to environmental degradation has contributed to poverty and deprivation in the area. Dependence on forest and land has become extremely difficult for the tribal way of live. The rate of growth in population and diminishing forest cover makes them extremely vulnerable. Therefore, an integrated, holistic development approach revolving around building their local resources and skills to improve the agriculture and Non Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) needs to be adopted to address the issue of tribal poverty and build their economies.",

        "project_explanation": "The Project consists of forest protection activities, including emission reduction in the mangrove forests of about 11,650 ha (REDD), and afforestation activities of about 11,840 ha on bare land and grassland (ARR) in a protected forest of about 23,500 ha in Organ Komering Irir, South Sumatra, Indonesia. The main ecosystems of these two regions are mangrove forests and grassland, bare land and shrub land, respectively, which are separated by boundaries. Mangrove forest in the region has been severely affected by forest deforestation caused by the conversion to shrimp ponds since the beginning of 1990’s. Mangrove forest in this region had decreased by about 540 ha (9787 ha to 9248 ha) from 1990 to 2012, while bare land area had increased by about 1200 ha (450 ha to 1685 ha). In this project area, the impacts of construction of artificial waterways to transport materials necessary for activities in adjacent industrial forests, the spread of fire due to fire outside the project area, and the development due to misidentification of unclear boundary line with outside the project area can be seen. In mangrove forest areas in particular, there has been a large number of small-scale activities for the development of shrimp aquaculture ponds and the logging for that, and these activities are a major cause of deforestation in this area. This is evident from field surveys, satellite image analysis and interviews. This trend is also gradually expanding in the areas adjacent to the project area, and if the situation continues, the deforestation of the protected forests is likely to continue. Originally, the project area is a protected forest, and cutting down for shrimp farming is prohibited, but in this area, it has been conventionally carried out for livelihood, and the law is not generally observed. The project will reduce CO2 emissions by taking appropriate preventive measures for drivers and curbing the progress of deforestation. In addition, where there is an old aquaculture pond, the silvo fishery method will be used to plant trees while preventing leakage. The purpose of this project is to prevent further deforestation by providing local people with alternative means to support the lives of them such as opportunities for participation and cooperation in forest conservation and afforestation projects. Therefore, as a result of communication with local residents focusing on the sustainable development of the local society for many years before the start of the project, a deep relationship of trust has been built, and participation and cooperation in the project by them have been actively carried out. These include the organization of farmers' groups, forest patrols and afforestation activities. The monitoring of carbon storage is carried out by the combination of satellite image analysis and field measurement (ground truth). Landsat images are used to classify land cover. Field measurements are also made to identify the actual vegetation and to obtain data to estimate the carbon factor of the forest in the project area. It is estimated to contribute to an annual reduction of approximately 57,000 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 absorbed by afforestation activities is estimated to be at an average of about 180,000 tons per year from 2022. After registering with the Verra, we will use the funds from the credit sales to maintain the project and return the funds to local residents through the construction of schools and other facilities and the provision of educational and employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the creation of a sustainable local community.",

These benefits include the mitigation of climate change, an increase in carbon (CO2) sequestration and forest cover, and the conservation of flora and fauna in the region. The project is located in the Taru Ranch property in the village of Taru in Kwale County, about 60 kilometers northwest of Mombasa, Kenya’s second largest city. The nearly 16,674 ha ranch is situated in the southeastern plains of Kenya. The bounding coordinates for the property are 9,605,191.95 m N, 9,583,436.15 m N, 528,392.84 m E, and 517,402.76 m E (WGS 1984 UTM Zone 37 South). The project is aimed at conserving the current forest through the protection of a large area of natural Miombo forests by means of activities of Avoided Unplanned Deforestation (8011.72 ha) and activities of Avoided Planned Deforestation (1884.8 ha). The main agents of deforestation in the project area are the local populations that live in the project area (Taru village) and the surrounding areas, with 450 families in the following villages: Mwembeni, Nyari, Mitunguni, Mwakunde, Kazamoyo, Vidzandani, and Mwadzungi. As a result of the difficult environmental and economic conditions in the region, this projects climate objectives depend on the success of community-oriented project activities, such as a tree-planting program, community gardens, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, a water supply program, a daycare service for women working on the farm, the promotion of environmental awareness, and an empowerment program for women. This project has the potential to avoid the emission of 486,755.18 tCO2 over the 30 years it will take to complete this project.",

In addition, the are includes several types of valuable forest, among them the aguajales, which are the wetlands with the greatest carbon sequestration capacity in the Amazon, making this an essential ecosystem to conserve. The Last Habitat REDD+ project is designed under the avoided planned deforestation methodology as this area was originally sold to the project proponent with the authorization to convert the forested areas in agrarian production lands (camu camu, palm oil, piñon, and cattle ranching). Despite having the legal authorization to carry out traditional productive activities, BAM, with its own resources, has promoted the conservation of these valuable forests and its biodiversity over the years by implementing different strategies and activities such: territorial supervision with technical and legal support, forest surveillance activities, permanent work with communities for improving their capacities in sustainable forestry management, among others. Such conservation efforts will only be feasible and sustainable over time with the support of carbon revenues from the proposed REDD+ project.",

The research station is located on the western edge of the Reserva Comunal El Sira (RC El Sira), a national protected area established to protect the pristine montane rainforests of the Cordillera El Sira. The buffer zone of the RCS and its surrounding area is mainly populated by indigenous communities and small-scale farmers. Intensive deforestation in this area in favour of pastures has resulted in fragments of primary rainforests existing primarily as islands between pastures. In this respect, the private nature reserve of Panguana currently forms a peninsula with an intact connection to the untouched rainforests in the heart of the RC El Sira. Restoration of degraded pastureland and rehabilitation of secondary forests adjacent to existing old growth forests at Panguana presents the opportunity to conserve an important biodiversity corridor as well as an effective strategy for rehabilitation of degraded tropical forest across the region. The project has the following main goals: • Restore natural rainforests on pastures within the area of the Panguana foundation (~140 ha) • Accelerate forest restoration by testing different approaches and developing best practices for local conditions • Introduce sustainable food and tree production systems (permaculture, aquaponics, tree nursery) • Only use inexpensive materials and methods, easily available in the region • Exchange knowledge and develop a sustainable landscape management together with local stakeholders (indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, local institutions) It is expected that the project activities will lead to a mean annual removal of ~16 t CO2e per hectare during the first 20 years.",

Thereby, emissions will be eliminated from the extraction and processing of logs, from collateral mortality of felling operations, and from roads, skidding trails and other infrastructure. The forest will be protected from disturbance, reducing emissions from logging operations and allowing carbon content to accumulate over time, taking advantage of the overall trend of carbon accumulation in Amazonian forests. Any negative effects that biodiversity may have experienced from logging operations will be allowed to recover. The project will work with surrounding communities to establish an active conservation program for their benefit and for that of the climate and the forest’s biodiversity and ecosystem health. Jobs will include forest rangers, eco-guides, research and monitoring assistants and other support staff. Forest rangers will regularly patrol the project area, particularly its fluvial access routes, to detect and deter illegal logging, hunting and encroachment.

In this region we find the natural habitat of endangered animal species such as the black caiman (Melanosuchus Niger), the harpy eagle (Harpy Eagle) and the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) as well as habitat for forest species of economic importance as chestnut (bertholletia excelsa). Currently, Madre de Dios faces an abrupt change in land use and accelerated forest degradation; historically, this same region was characterized by low levels of deforestation, so that the impact generated, affects the well-preserved status of this area. This change may be a result of the construction of the South Inter-Oceanic Highway, which generated greater accessibility and therefore increased immigration. In this scenario, we need to add up the advancement of informal gold mining, fueled by the rising price of gold, whose mode of extraction is highly polluting and causing deforestation in areas adjacent to the rivers of the region.The project will be developed in the Native Community of Ese'Eja Infierno and its Ecotourism Concession located in Madre de Dios, these areas belong politically to the province of Tambopata, Tambopata District, adding a total area of 7749.94 hectares. The purpose of the project is to conserve community forests and their concession, against de rapidly increase of deforestation. The project proposes to reduce the pressure to change the use of land in the project area through the promotion of sustainable economic activities, forest governance and the establishment of conservation agreements on critical areas previously identified. These actions are intended to avoid the expansion of agriculture; to achieve them, permanent coordination and alliances will be made with institutions that currently are conducting conservation activities in the area.Also, the control and monitoring system of the community and its concession will be strengthened, emphasizing on the formation and operation of forest guards, which have an official recognition of the Regional Directorate of Forestry and Wildlife of Madre de Dios, which represents a strategy of community involvement.With these actions, the project hopes to avoid annual average net emissions of 117,676.00 tCO2-e. in the referenced scenario during the first 10 years period, in which, because of migration and occupation of the land that promotes the operation of the South Interoceanic Highway, an average of 289.76 ha per year will be deforested.The project includes benefits for the concerned people and the conservation of biodiversity, beyond the benefits of reducing GHG emissions.

Currently, concessioners’ activity is limited to subsistence Brazil nut collection and, in a very few cases, subsistence forestry. The long-term wellbeing of concessioners and their families is highly dependent on the health of local ecosystems, but they have few resources with which to protect their concessions. Illegal deforestation on concession land has increased due to the new InterOceanic Highway, which passes through Madre de Dios. The construction of this road has brought unusually high numbers of migrants to the area, many of whom use concession land to fulfill their housing and work needs.

The park, owned by the government of Peru, is managed and financed by the Peruvian NGO Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Áreas Naturales (CIMA) through a public-private partnership piloted by the Peruvian government. The project’s avoided-deforestation objective is accomplished by strengthening park protection, engaging local communities and other stakeholders in land-use management compatible with conservation, and improving the quality of life of the park’s neighbors. Approximately 180,000 people in more than 200 communities – immigrant and indigenous – neighbor the park. Villagers close to the park mostly practice subsistence agriculture; those closer to major roads engage in market activities as well. CIMA and its close advisor, The Field Museum in Chicago, have worked with communities since 2002 to ensure that the project activities incorporate and reflect the values and aspirations of local residents. The project activities are highly participatory, with villagers leading several efforts and developing competencies that will enable long-term success.The biodiversity in the project area is astounding. Intact forests stretch from lowlands (150 meters) to ragged mountain peaks (2,400 meters). This eastern outlier of the Andes has been isolated sufficiently long for speciation to occur: more than 35 species new to science have been discovered in the park to date. The forests harbor rare and endangered species, as well as abundant populations of animals and plants that are crucial to the well-being of park neighbors.",

Both areas have different contexts and social, economic and cultural practices, and a variety of natural resources in their territories. The conservation of the tropical dry forests of this zone are considered important to avoid desertification, watershed management, conserve endemic biodiversity and provide ecosystem services to a growing population.The Regional Conservation Area Salitral-Huarmaca Dry Forests extends over two districts in the region of Piura, Salitral in the province of Morropón and Huarmaca in the province of Huancabamba. The Regional Conservation Area has an approximate area of 28 811 hectaresThe rural community of Santo Domingo de Olmos is located in the district of Olmos, in this region. The community has an estimated population of 36 500 inhabitants and an area of 277 878 hectares The project is developed in the Regional Conservation Area Salitral Huarmaca Dry Forests and Rural Community of Santo Domingo de Olmos with a project area of 38 355 hectares of tropical dry forests. The purpose of the project is to preserve the dry forest against the threats of deforestation and degradation. It is proposed to reduce the pressure of land use change in the project area by three components: a) Appropriate use of environmental territory, b) Development of organizational, social and technical capabilities for the management of the natural resources c) Implementation of initiatives for forest conservation.With these actions, the project will avoid an annual average net emissions of 46,583.28 tCO2-e according to the baseline scenario projected for the first 10 years. The project includes benefits for the communities involved and for the conservation of endemic biodiversity. The project has applied the standard of the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Association (CCBA) achieving the gold level for the protection of endangered species such as White-winged Guan (Penelope albipennis).",

As a result, the livelihoods of farming families will be enhanced and poverty reduced. The project design is applicable to landowning smallholder farmers across Peru who have in the past relied on ‘slash and burn’ shifting cultivation agriculture or ranching that resulted in unproductive agricultural lands and degraded pastures. The project will provide seedlings and training to farmers to reforest their farms, converting them from low productivity migratory agriculture where they have to rotate farmed areas to market-orientated agroforestry systems.

BDU II trust funds comprises 20 properties or plots located in the Central East region of Uruguay (the host country), with a total area of 14,657 ha of which, 9,363 ha are effectively planted. The unplanted area, 5,404 ha, remaining in part as natural grasslands, are used for cattle grazing and flora and fauna conservation. Given that an important portion of BDU II trust fund effectively planted area had already established plantations (8,307 ha) when the trust fund started to operate, they cannot be included within the VCS project boundary. The BDU II project eligible for the VCS standard is circumscribed to 1,056 ha effectively planted after the trust fund operation starting date, carried out in 6 properties (5 entire plots and 29% of the 6th one). The project activity is carried out on lightly degraded land as a consequence of many decades of intensive cattle grazing. This degradation is expected to continue in the absence of the project. The project utilizes two species: E. grandis and E. dunnii that occupies 74% and 26% of the planted area, respectively. The project contributes to the sustainable development of Uruguay, specifically by: • Increasing labour demand from the local population • Adding value to wood products and diversifying the regional production will lead to higher economic revenues for the region. • Promoting an integrated management scheme with the ecosystem. • Developing and improving a new mechanism to finance projects in the forestry sector",
